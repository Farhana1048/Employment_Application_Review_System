# Employment_Application_Review_System
EARS is an intranet-based Employment Application Review System for the International School of Software.   Using this  system applicants will apply for the opening  job.  Faculty members will give review the applications of applicants and list the applicant  and collaborate asynchronously in order to  find the best applicant for the job.
This system reduces the overhead of the process and lightens the workload for the search chairperson. 

The scope of this project will be to provide a system that allows to: 
1. log-in EARS system 
2. manage system users (add new accounts) 
3. add a new faculty search (committee chair, members, position, search starting date and ending date, add new committee members) 
4. List and review applications (view profile, post comments on applicants, change applicants’ statues, perform a faculty review, assign faculty review) 
5. set account’s settings (email, name, title, password)
